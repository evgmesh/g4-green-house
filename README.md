# g4-green-house

The objective of this project was to implement a CO2 fertilization controller system for a greenhouse. The controller keeps CO2 level at the level that is set from the local user interface.
Controller connects to the cloud using MQTT and sends the measured CO2 level and other environmental information to the cloud for display and/or further processing.
